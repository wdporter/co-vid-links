can we agree on the definition of “vaccine?” Assume that we are 
talking about a totally legit traditional vaccine, one that has been 
around for years and is safe and effective. Fundamentally, what is it? 
Can we agree that a vaccine is a substance made from a weakened or dead 
version of the pathogen which is introduced into the bloodstream to 
induce an immune response? 

mRNA “vaccines” are not vaccines… No. What we are dealing with here is 
bio-technology and bio-engineering. In short, it is genetic modification.

Letter from English doctors to government

“I write with regard to the matter of potential covid vaccine and my desire to be fully informed and appraised of ALL facts before going ahead. I’d be most grateful if you could please provide the following information, in accordance with statutory legal requirements.”:

    Can you please advise the approved legal status of any vaccine and if it is experimental?

    Can you please provide details and assurances that the vaccine has been fully, independently and rigorously tested against control groups and the subsequent outcomes of those tests?

    Can you please advise the entire list of contents of the vaccine I am to receive and if any are toxic to the body?

    Can you please fully advise of all the adverse reactions associated with this vaccine since it’s introduction?

    Can you please confirm that the vaccine you are advocating is NOT experimental mRNA gene altering therapy?

    Can you please confirm that I will not be under any duress from yourselves as my employers, in compliance with the Nuremberg Code?

    Can you please advise me of the likely risk of fatality, should I be unfortunate to contract Covid 19 and the likelihood of recovery?

    Can you please advise me if I were to experience any adverse reactions is the manufacturer of the vaccine liable? If the manufacturer isn’t liable will the company I’m currently employed with with be responsible & liable as it is their request that I have the vaccine in order to carry on my employment?

Once I have received the above information in full and I am satisfied that there is NO threat to my health, I will be happy to accept your offer to receive the treatment, but with certain conditions – namely that:

    You confirm in writing that I will suffer no harm.

    Following acceptance of this, the offer must be signed by a fully qualified doctor who will take full legal and financial responsibility for any injuries occurring to myself, and/or from any interactions by authorized personnel regarding these procedures.

    In the event that I should have to decline the offer of vaccination, please confirm that it will not compromise my position and that I will not suffer prejudice and discrimination as a result?

I would also advise that my inalienable rights are reserved.

1.Religious Beliefs vs. Personal/Conscience Beliefs - Only mention that is "based upon my deeply held and sincere religious beliefs." Do not state anywhere in your form or letter that it is due to your "personal beliefs or conscience." While I think this is ridiculous and people can and should believe what they want, it is smart to ONLY keep it to "deeply held and sincere religious beliefs" so that any grey area is removed. I recommend using the Bible as the basis for this and state that it is the literal and direct word of God and Jesus Christ and it cannot be wrong.
State you are Christian, not Catholic - Not all Christians are Catholic and Catholics follow the Pope and his word. Not all Christians recognize the authority of the Pope. As we know, the Pope loves the vaccine. I cannot comment any other religions, sorry.new

Use the fetal cell line argument - This is pretty straightforward and a well known fact now. All jabs used fetal stem cell lines from aborted babies in either the early development and/or testing of said vaccines. State how it would be a sin due to Bible's stance on abortion.
State that you are aware other medications use fetal stem cells and that you do not use those either - Again, pretty straightforward. But you have to play this like chess. Counter their moves on why they would reject your letter/form. I don't care if it is true or not, do what you need to do to survive. Make it clear that you do not consume these other medications either for the same reason.
Cite Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the First Amendment of the Constitution - Just state these and how you are exercising your rights regarding freedom of religion and to not honor it would be discrimination and violation of your rights.
Cite Many Bible Scriptures - Wherever you are making points, be sure to provide direct quotations from the Bible and why it means you cannot take the jab. This helps prove your sincerity and that you read and follow the direct literal words of the Bible. No other judgement by your employer can be made from these. This is a very useful tool to help you find relevant Bible verses: https://www.openbible.info/topics/. Just type in your keyword or phrase and it will show scripture relevant to that. For example, type "truth" or "abortion" or "sin" and it will show useful quotes.
Do not mention anything about vaccine (in)effectiveness, conspiracies, anti-COVID stuff, personal views, etc. - This is to cover your ass and refers back to point #1. Keep it only to your "deeply held and sincere religious beliefs" and nothing else.
Either consult a lawyer or be very smart and legal about how you write your form/letter - For example, if your form asks for how long is the accommodation request for, be sure to state "duration of employment."
Be explicit that this is an exemption from the COVID-19 vaccine and any boosters - Be sure to mention boosters to cover your ass again.
Write it entirely in your own words - Do not copy any other letter you see or use a template. Write it in your own words to keep it as "sincere" as possible. Remove any doubt your employer can make.
